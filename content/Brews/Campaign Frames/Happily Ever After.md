# The Pitch
Vacation has become a whole lot more interesting when you find out that the lands in the Theme Park Capital of the world are not just built up stories, but windows into a magical realm.

# The Foundation

## Overview
The theme parks are a veil holding in the real worlds of the movies. Below that is the “fabric” that is the tapestry of shared stories. Everyone is normal in the parks, but those who can access the “other side” find their true powers. For those who want a buffet of settings to play in, this is your portal.

### Touchstones
  - "[Kingdom Keepers](LINK)"/“[[Kingdom Hearts]]”
  - “[[Inception]]” - Players will take on the role of “Storyteller” for each “realm” they enter. 
  - “[Vacationland](LINK)” - When in “The Real World” players will still be in the regular Magic Kingdom. Being On Vacation is still a must. 

## The World
### Important Places
#### Walt Disney World
This campaign will primarily focus much of it’s action around Walt Disney World, the parks and surrounding infrastructure (hotels, transportation etc.)

# Character Guidance 
> For players to understand how to best interact with the word
## Player Principles

### Player Driven Worlds
Many of the scenes within this campaign will have a high level of player input. In some cases players will have full control to describe the environment, people and other important details of the different stories they enter. 

## GM Principles
### Keeping Continuity But Not Driving It
As established above players will have a wide latitude to create within this world. As a GM I will try and remind players of important creations or details in an effort to keep things cohesive
## Campaign Mechanics 
**Real World/Magical World** | in the regular world players do not have access to their magic or weapons. They do have access to any physical feats, experiences and proficiencies they may have or gain along the way. Anything that has a magical quality must either be performed in the magical realms or have some strenuous cost to try and materialize it in the real world. 

**Imagineer/Storyteller** |This PC powers the world the group enters. One person is designated as the imagineer of the experience. They design the way in and way out of the world and the places you can interact with in there. Even some of the NPCs. They have great power to manipulate the space, but they will also be a great target of adversaries in the imaginary world. 
Storytellers will take **2 Stress** at the start of every realm they create. 

# [[Session Zero]] 

## Inciting Incident
We’ll discuss what brings all the characters together in the Magic Kingdom and what is the first trip into the imaginary realm.
