# Character Guidance 
> For players to understand how to best interact with the world

## Player Principles
### Bring What You Want Into This New World
Since this isn’t exactly the past, you can decide to bring in as much pop culture from the real world as you’d like. Maybe you might try and bring Star Wars 20 years early, or try and find this world’s Audrey Hepburn, or Alfred Hitchcock. 

# [[Session Zero]]

## Inciting Incident
The start of this campaign would begin in the modern day. As part of Session Zero we can discuss what transports the players to this alternate world.
