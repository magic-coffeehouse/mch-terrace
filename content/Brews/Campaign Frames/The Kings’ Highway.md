# The Pitch
The banners are called, brooms are readied, and the road is set for the most exciting race of all time! It’s been a score and two more since the first **Journey** concluded and established peace across the realm. Since then, **The Podium of Kings** have decreed that every five years representatives from any house may compete for the opportunity to ascend the throne to rule the lands. **The Journey** across The Kings’ Highway is an opportunity not just for those who win. Great treasures await all who participate… and survive!


# The Foundation

## Overview
In the Kings’ Highway, players are brought into a world where magic is powered by play and competition. The start of the campaign will be on the eve of the Grand Depart. While the most well funded houses seek to stand atop the podium, many still participate for the fame and accolades. Others participate for the chance to find very rare magical items that can only be formed when such a competition is held.

> For players to understand how to best interact with the world## Player Principles (Detailed)

## Player Principles 

### Fulfillment Beyond Winning
While many racers look to be the first across the finish line, there is still merit towards racing even if you have no chance of winning. You will likely not be able to win every part of the race, but there will be many opportunities to explore personal goals other than winning.

## GM Princples

### Engage Everyone
Not everyone has to be a Broom Flyer. There will be many opportunities for each player to be engaged in all parts of play. 
### Encourage Teamwork
Even though racers often race for themselves, it often takes a team for any one individual to be successful 

### It's Not Just About Sports (I Promise!)


## Campaign Mechanics
### Games Are Magic
magic-based features may require some form of play or competition to become empowered. This may also mean that a feature may become refreshed mid-race, allowing you to use it more than once. 
#### Training
As a rest action, take a stress during rest to ready some magic.
