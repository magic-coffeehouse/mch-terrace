# Character Guidance 
> For players to understand how to best interact with the world

## Player Principles 
### Lean into Camp
We are unserious pirates! If you have a choice pick the most fun one 
### Interpersonal Dynamics
Try to roleplay friction across the crew (including with other PCs), but alway aim to resolve your differences by the end of the "episode".

## GM Principles 
### Establish A Diverse World of People and Places

### Aim to be Narratively Satifying
While there may be high emotional drama the goal should always be to land on an emotionally satisfying conclusion  across an arc. 
## Campaign Mechanics
Boat stuff


# [[Session Zero]]
## Build Map
Secret to the players is that the sea is a very large pool surrounded by land in all but one semi large inlet to the Northwest. The sea is known to be so large that most people who try and map the space never return. 

## Inciting Incident
How might the crew have come together, this could be played out in the first session or we can pick up the start as a fully formed crew.
