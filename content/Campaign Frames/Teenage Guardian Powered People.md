### Touchstones
  - "[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]"/"[[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon]]"/"Persona Series
  - "[[Buffy The Vampire Slayer]]"

## The World
### Important Places

#### Community Center
Some place like a community center or arcade where students hang out after school

#### High School
### Important People

#### Principal 

#### Some Guiding Figure
This would be like a Zordon or Luna that informs the teens about their magic powers and alerts them when something bad is happening.

### Distinctions
> What makes this world unique

#### Secret Magical World
World is very normal and 90s. However under the surface there is a set of magical people affecting the world. 
# Character Guidance 
> For players to understand how to best interact with the world

## Player Principles 

### So High School
All players will be teens in high school. So role play like you’re a teen!

### Different Seats At The Cafeteria
A common trope for these groups is that this bestowing of power puts people together who wouldn’t normally interact with one another. It would be cool to try and establish those differences at the onset and work towards building teamwork and camaraderie throughout the campaign. 

## GM Principles 
### Episodic Storytelling
I will aim to try and keep sessions as episodic as possible. Meaning we won’t try and cram too many things at once in a session. We’ll move quickly through things so that we can reach a satisfying conclusion to the problem of the session

### Teamwork Makes The Theme Work
Whenever possible, it is encouraged to suggest moves that require mutliple PCs to work together on an action or objective. I will do my best to always encourage and facilitate such actions. 
## Campaign Mechanics

### Magical Girl Transformation
Generally you’ll have access to most of your personal abilities. Special Powers and weapons will require you to transform. You cannot be seen to transform though! You have to find a place where no one can see you. 
# [[Session Zero]]

## Build Map
We’ll design the town the players reside in. 

## Inciting Incident
