# The Pitch
All aboard a wild adventure across the magical Brasslands! Travel the magical network of rails that can take you from the Western Reach all the way to the tip of the Crescent Coast. Confront the wild frontier of the terminal stations and discover what it’s like living life on a fast train.  

# The Foundation

## Overview
Magical Rail has brought fast expansion across the realm. Towns turned into cities overnight, and realms that were once thought impossible to traverse now are connected by an ever growing system of rails. But rapid growth comes with its own challenges. Bandits attack trains that are traveling along the realm’s most vulnerable places, and an every expanding race to control the most track with the most advanced trains threatens to change life on the rails as we know it.

### Touchstones
  - "[[The Rocketeer]]"
  - "[Wild Wild West](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120891/)"
  - "[Guns of Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_of_Icarus_Online)"

## The World

### Important Places
#### The Train
Your train will be the group’s home for most of the journey. 
#### Union Tree
The center of the Brasslands. It is believed that all rails lead back to Union Tree. 

### Important People

#### The Creator
Powerful wizard that was able to develop a means to making railway connections via magic. 

### Distinctions
> What makes this world unique
#### Good Trains Are Rare
Laying track is as simple for some as thinking. However the ability to make a good transport has not matched the ability to lay rail. 

# Character Guidance 
> For players to understand how to best interact with the world
## Player Principles 
### Be Confident to Take Bold Action
Players should be encouraged to take risks to make exciting play. This will be a high risk, high reward form of play. We can work together to define what the line of appropriate impact might be for failed rolls (removing character death for example)

### Play Fast
Tied with the above principle, this Campaign Frame encourages quick decision making and trying to establish flow as much as possible. 
## GM Principles 
### Keep Things Moving
I’ll encourage the group to not idle too long on a scene. Similarly NPCs will generally be geared towards moving on quickly

### Sense of Time Passing While Discouraging FOMO
Things will move on without the players. I’ll ail to provide what’s relevant without using FOMO as a means to regretting one’s actions. There will always be interesting opportunities.
