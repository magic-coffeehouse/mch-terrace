DnD campaign idea where players are part of a school that's loosely based on [[Bauhaus]]. In this case, Design would be replaced with magic(?). Commentary on the world would still be paramount to the fantasy aspect of the story. 

Teachers would try to teach "Good Design" in magic. One where use and purpose are considered thoughtfully. Additionally it would highlight collaboration (teamwork) and mechanically encourage creative solutions to Adventuring Problems. 

Conflict would arise between two factions that think their use of Bauhaus teachings are "the right way". [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] that is bad for society (see [[Wagner's ideal for the Ring Cycle]])
# The Pitch
In the land where the great mountain meets the sea lies the greatest school in the world. Lux Universalis is open to any and all folk whose journey finds them on school grounds. 

# The Foundation

## Overview
In the high fantasy setting of Lux Universalis, players interact with the legendary school. They learn about the world and adventuring through classes and teachers at the school. Eventually they may find themselves on a journey that puts what they’ve learned to the true test!

### Touchstones
  - "[[Mobile Suit Gundam - The Witch From Mercury]]"
  - "[[The Magicians]]", but like not depressing

### Important People
#### The Founding Faculty
Group of Professors that built and run the school

## Distinctions

### The Journey To School is Difficult
Many people turn away before they’re able to conquer the mountain or the sea to arrive at the school. While at the school, students often group themselves by how they arrived; by Mountain, by Sea, or by Fate (birth, some other way)
### Magic is Rare But Can Be Found
Most people outside of school cannot perform magic. But LU has found a very high success rate in teaching its students how to find their magic.
