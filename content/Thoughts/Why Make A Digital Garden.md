title: Why Make a Digital Garden
---
I love the non-conventional way a [[Digital Garden]] allows people to explore a site with curiosity rather than via an algorithm. Ideas can be made important or relevant not by how complete the concept is, but rather by the reader’s interest in the moment. 

Making a Digital Garden for Magic Coffeehouse will allow me to share ideas that are still forming and get feedback from people who are interested in seeing more from a specific concept. Simultaneously, I hope it encourages others to generate their own ideas and take them further than I could alone. 

# Your Own Personal Wikipedia
Eventually I may describe on here my [[Journey Through Note Taking|journey through note taking]], but the most relevant aspect to the question above is my use of  [Obsidian](FIX LINK). I have been taking notes in Obsidian for over a year and it has felt like a revelation to my note taking habit. It’s allowed me to rediscover ideas and notes through the fun of hoping through links like you’re on Wikipedia. Paired with Digital Gardening, it now seems like there is a clear path to having an outlet for some of these ideas that could blossom into newer thoughts or [[MCH Projects|projects]].
