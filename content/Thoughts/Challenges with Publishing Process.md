As defined in [[Publishing Process]] I’m accepting some level of friction in favor of privacy and some level of curation. Here are some challenges ive identified with this process

# Content Management

## Note Name vs Public Title
Sometimes there is a collision with the name of a general note and an article or idea I want to write for The Terrace. This means i may need to adjust article headline to align more with the public facing title. The follow on issue is that i have trouble remembering how to link portions of The Terrace together because their title names do not conform with how I’ve been linking notes in my main vault. Linking is the most beneficial aspect of this form of collected writing. So in this way I am also working harder to present meaningful links to the reader and may forget to make a useful association here. 

# Differences Between Vaults
I just took 20 minutes looking for a file that simply might not exist in my main vault. This is probably highlighting that i have to be more explicit about keeping a 1:1 mapping of content as much as possible.
