Based on [Quartz documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/authoring-content), all content for the site needs to reside in the `content` folder of the site. Since The Terrace acts as a public portion of my overall Obsidian vault, I go through a process of taking authored content and migrating it over to be published

1. Write authored content in personal vault
2. Store content in folder called `Terrace`
3. Copy contents of Terrace over to `content` folder. 
4. Open folder in Obsidian and fix/remove links that do not work in this vault. 
5. [[How This Garden is Set Up|Publish]]

I think this generally goes against common convention. However I find I'm conflicted between having a unified, single vault that stores very private items and having some portion of that also be available for public viewing. 

## Written Public Content vs General Notes
Another challenge I have is that my personal vault is written much more [atomically](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes) than anything written for public consumption. Atomic notes allow for a much more connectivity between ideas generating various forms of context stemming from a single notion. 
Public consumption makes that harder to convey without presenting the entire vault to the public. Additionally, writing with a public facing lens in mind is a helpful practice that allows for meaning to be more easily shared. 

So in general, I guess i accept that there will be some [[Challenges with Publishing Process|friction]] in this process to ensure some level of privacy and the ability to curate content to some degree.
